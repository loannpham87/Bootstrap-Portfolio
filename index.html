I am a bit of a vagabond, as I’ve lived in Fremont, Nebraska, Sioux City, Iowa, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Elkhart, Indiana and now my forever home: Bonney Lake, Washington. Nowhere really quite felt like home until I put my first foot on Washington’s soil. For three months, my husband and I lived in hotels and traveled from state to state, depending on where his job took him, and in between his assignments, we would fly back to Washington to continue our house-hunting. </p>

I was also the first and only of three siblings to graduate high school. For reference, I am the middle child so it’s true what they say; we are in constant need of others’ validation. Although a Bachelor’s degree in BA/CIS may seem like a big accomplishment, that’s actually not what I’m most academically proud of. I already know that I will be most proud to graduate the University of Washington’s Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. I know this because of the amount of time, effort, and passion I put into learning the material and I know because when I’m doing it, it doesn’t feel burdensome or taxing. I whole-heartedly have enjoyed every second of learning full-stack (even the frustrating moments) because I know that I am one step closer to getting the career I want.</p>              </div>

I am a coffee connoisseur. I love cooking, particularly French cuisine but also Mexican, Vietnamese, Italian, Mediterranean, Greek, Iranian – basically, any part of Europe or Asia. My interest in different cuisines come from traveling internationally and maybe a few binges of the many food docuseries available on Netflix. I also love to bake and that’s mostly because I’m fat. I love dark beers and spirits (booze not demons), particularly scotch, whiskey, rum, cognac, porters, stouts, ambers, malts – honestly, if it’s brown, I’m down. I also love craft cocktails. Maybe I just love alcohol. I love gardening, indoors and out. I am a houseplant hobbyist and own over 75 houseplants, of which, only two are dying. I also crochet occasionally, ‘cause it’s never too late to get into grandma mode. I also hike, scuba-dive, paint (mainly acrylics), and am well-versed in carpool karaoke. </p>
